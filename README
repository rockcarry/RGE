 About
=======
RGE is a cross-platform draw2d graphics lib, which support dos, windows and linux platforms.
Using this lib, you can create bitmap objects, and render geometrys on them.

=========
 License
=========
RGE is freeware under GNU GPL license. 

==============
 How to build
==============
Now RGE is only work on mingw32 windows environment.

You can build it on Windows(mingw32 & msys-git) or Linux(mingw32 & git):

cd RGE/src
make CC=mingw32-gcc
you shold replace "mingw32-gcc" witch you own mingw32-gcc compiler.

 Features
==========
- simple designed, accord with KISS
- screen bmp object stand for physics screen, isolating platform & hardware difference
- cross-platform supports

============
 Screen bmp
============
A screen bmp is a implement of BMP object , which stand for a physics screen, such as VGA/SVGA screen in dos, frame buffer in linux, or window & directdraw screen in windows. Any operations on screen bmp will be shown on physics screen. It means you can immediately see what you are drawing.

=========================
 Supported pixel formats
=========================
Each bmp object can support RGB 8bit 256 color, 16bit RGB565, 24bit RGB888, 32bit RGB888.

=============
 Performance
=============
RGE is completely implement by software, with out any opengl or direct3d hardware acceleration.
So it is not fast, hehe.
